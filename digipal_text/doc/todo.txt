        enforce structure:
            flat structure: p and no divs
            p at the top level
            locations within ps
    
    If select 520, show 520, 520a1, ...
        e.g. 210a exists but 170a not

        4 hides under 14a1 is interpreted as an entry number

        Q: should we use an intermediary record to represent any type of entity? There are some commonalities among rec types such as normalised name, name before and after conquest, etc. 
        Or do we link directly to a Person/Place record?
        Q: what about the distinction between identified entity and occurrence of an entity name?

    Switch edit/view

BUGS
    
    Make sure we can't save the content before it is loaded
    What if you edit the same text in different panels?
    Fix the slug in the admin:
        the slug should be read only
        for the moment we always update the slug automatically on save
    TinyMCE will not work well (setContent and editing mode fails) when the panel is collapse at the time of the loading

    
Presentation
    resizing a panel doesn't work smoothly when the mouse goes over TinyMCE
    Fix the panelset being a few pixels too tall
    Layout switches
    Put the digipal style sheets back
        put them back
        fix the banner/nav
    [DONE] relative size of the panels. e.g. 50% split centre and south
    Improve the layout so if the set ratios are preserved even when resizing the browser window
    (Re)design:
        decide if the layout is completely managed by the viewer
        would be nice if west is on the left of south: that would require to nest one layout inside another
    BUG: when you close the south pane the iframe managed by the nested tinymce will loose the content of its head and body.

Improvements
    Panel asks for location list and types. Populate and show controls accordingly (e.g. Text may not want to display it at this stage, Image only shows locations not types).
    Status messages should come from the server?
    auto-save before large operations

    saving
        saving bugs
            requirements:
                don't count loading as a modification of the text
                don't save too many times
                save all changes
            
            method:
                use on change event on tinmyce
                    => not triggered until the cursor is moved out of the current line
                        e.g. append chars at the end of a line => nothing, move cursor up => triggered
                        => we may miss changes if the user closes the tab after writing
                compare the size of the content every x seconds
                    => it won't catch modifications which preserve the same length
                    => not the most efficient as we have to get the content each time that's extra processing
                use both
                    => save is triggered twice
            
        regular saving
            avoid simultaneous savings
            avoid too frequent savings
            
        [DONE] backup button
            add a new table: TextContentXMLBackup
            add a button to save to this table
            
    
Performance
    The full Exon translation (experiment with FireFox):
        can be added with tinymce, pasted from Word it will strip almost all styles and keep minimal HTML
        pasting takes a long time (~20s) but it is decent given the size of the text however it freezes the browser and we can get javascript performance warnings
        the size is 310KB
        loading the text takes just 150ms but setting it into TinyMCE make the browser freeze for a few seconds 
        sending the text and saving it to the DB takes less than 1 seconds however the browser tends to freeze and be very laggy after a few operations

Maybe
    Image Panel
        layout selection (width fit, height fit, best fit)
    ? show address selector
    Let panels from different browser tabs communicate
        synchronise position
        edition + refresh views, etc.
    Name tables in the admin: in the future we may want to 
        make the slug input writable
        keep the slug as it is even when the name changes 
        but if the slug is blanked (or add an icon for that) we reset it.
    Generalise API:
        query for the list of locations and this can be handled by the custom function on server side
    Show status bar at the bottom of each panel:
        duration of the request
        icon to show the message in full
