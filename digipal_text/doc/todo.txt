        icon to show the message in full

    ** mark-up
        gaps

    More efficient saving:
        if saving is long, the save requests may overlap
            => don't send another request if one is not back yet 
            => make sure we save only when 1.5 secs inactivity on the keyboard

    create dummy text, three pages long

    ? mark-up records
        person
        place
        Q: should we use an intermediary record to represent any type of entity? There are some commonalities among rec types such as normalised name, name before and after conquest, etc. 
        Or do we link directly to a Person/Place record?
        Q: what about the distinction between identified entity and occurrence of an entity name?

    Bug
        Make sure we can't save the content before it is loaded
        What if you edit the same text in different panels?
        Fix the slug in the admin:
            the slug should be read only
            for the moment we always update the slug automatically on save
        TinyMCE will not work well (setContent and editing mode fails) when the panel is collapse at the time of the loading
    
    Presentation
        resizing a panel doesn't work smoothly when the mouse goes over TinyMCE
        Fix the panelset being a few pixels too tall
        Layout switches
        Put the digipal style sheets back
            put them back
            fix the banner/nav
        [DONE] relative size of the panels. e.g. 50% split centre and south
        Improve the layout so if the set ratios are preserved even when resizing the browser window
        (Re)design:
            decide if the layout is completely managed by the viewer
            would be nice if west is on the left of south: that would require to nest one layout inside another
        BUG: when you close the south pane the iframe managed by the nested tinymce will loose the content of its head and body.
    
    Performance
        The full Exon translation (experiment with FireFox):
            can be added with tinymce, pasted from Word it will strip almost all styles and keep minimal HTML
            pasting takes a long time (~20s) but it is decent given the size of the text however it freezes the browser and we can get javascript performance warnings
            the size is 310KB
            loading the text takes just 150ms but setting it into TinyMCE make the browser freeze for a few seconds 
            sending the text and saving it to the DB takes less than 1 seconds however the browser tends to freeze and be very laggy after a few operations
    
    Maybe
        ? show address selector
        Let panels from different browser tabs communicate
            synchronise position
            edition + refresh views, etc.
        Name tables in the admin: in the future we may want to 
            make the slug input writable
            keep the slug as it is even when the name changes 
            but if the slug is blanked (or add an icon for that) we reset it.
        Generalise API:
            query for the list of locations and this can be handled by the custom function on server side
