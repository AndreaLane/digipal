UI improvements
    *** change the sync to a master location
        add LT and L drop downs to top bar
        populate-merge them after all panels are loaded
        populate-merge after a panel type change
        hide location type if only one option
        change in LT
        change in L
        add sync button to 
    
        improve auto-complete
        add location on top
        by default the panels are synced with it
        when synced, hidden location in panel
        panels can be synced + 1 or  -1
        can then implement the scrolling to next unit
        bi-dir synced
    ** page navigation:
        easier navigation to prev/next page
        scrolling
        use TOC to navigate?
    * image
        auto frame to page
        can auto frame to <->
        can auto-frame to |
    [done] too many buttons
        show only essentials, only show the rest when hover
    * expandable panels
    frame ratio preserved when resizing the viewport
    status bar
        hide it x seconds after a successful message has been displayed 
    the sync UI is not intuitive: the name of the source can be confused with
        the type of content in the panel
    show detailed location (e.g. Count of Mortain, Somerset, Hand)
    improve the search
        search in different texts
        search across corpus?

TOC

Done:
    fixed some important problems with the excessive resource usage by the framework on the server
        which made the site crash, run very slowly or fail to index the content for the search page.
    worked on porting the visualisation from MoA to Exon
    automatically detected the pages in the images, which means that the thumbnails show the page only
        ** the viewers will benefit from it by showing the meaningful portion of the image
    * working on usability enhancement of the text viewer
        [done] scrolling issues
        ** navigation: prev / nex
        * sync will work differently:
            One location for the whole TE at the top
            By default all panels are sync'ed with that location
            Sync is BOTH WAYS, so moving in one panel will move the master location
            Possibility to unsync and go free
            => MUCH SIMPLER UI, enables bidir sync, - can't sync a-b then c-d
    ** working on the TOC

Bugs:

    [done] hand not showing
    [done] Entry type facets is like the TIC facets
[done] empty hands and texts results

[DONE] Fix the sync

(1) the p and the q  are not real letters but created by me by using a strike through.
This is entirely my fault. At the moment these do not appear in the text at all.
I suggest replacing the p with ṕ (unicode IE55) and the q with a ƣ (unicode 01A3).
They will then appear as p and q in the final text.
The ṕ should appear before all occurrences of ro as a separate word in italics.
Restoring the ƣ is more complicated. I would happily do both these operations on Sunday morning and send a new text to you
(I'm away this afternoon and all tomorrow)

See 12b1: defendit se #p#ro .x. hidis. exceptis consuetudinibus #q#uae ƥertinent ad firmam

(2) The machine does not seem to have coped with the occurences of qui+superscript i etc where
we wanted to lose the superscript to give plain qui.
Other examples are –rr (for rr –aa (for –a+superscript a) -ii (for i+superscript i) –oo (for o+superscript o).
It seems to me that you will need to instruct the programme to eliminate the superscripts, if that is possible.
If not, maybe we need a new way of dealing with these letters for the future.
I could go through mechanically and eliminate these spare letters from the text I sent you.
While we might manage a global to eliminate ii et cetera, we cant simply eliminate ii as that
would remove numbers (= 2) and things like denarii where the double i is part of the word, not a textual device.

    fixed, pb with sup/sub styles not detected properly

(3) All the line breaks (|) seem to have disappeared!

    fixed

(4) A few rogues remain in the finished text. I noticed some superscript 4s and also some ᵬᵬ (for bb).

    GN: ᵬᵬ found in beginning of 23r, converted to b but why is it not expanded? Isn't ᵬ an abbreviation mark?

    4 & 5

        reddit4e
            original contains both expension and abbreviations. Now removed.

        .iii. hidas. &4 dimidiam.
            That's an Ellis mistake, there is no abbrv. mark in 9b3

        §20a2 In berę hundr& st̃ .xlix. hiđ 7 .i. uirga. Inde h&5 rex .
            where is the 5 coming from? not in rekeyed text
(G1) double strikethrough
    9a7: Barones regis. =de his h[abe]ñt= .xxxv.
        => seems to be dashed underlined in MS and Ellis but not in RT
    §[9a2] In hund de Stafort st. c. 7 .v.. hiđ[ae] =7 dim4[idia]= Inde
        => single ST in Ellis, thivk in MS
    PB1: double-strikethrough in MSW is exported as an empty class in XHTML which is ambiguous
        this is because there is no CSS equivalent
        => one solution would be to use dashed underlined or single-strikethrough
        => could manually set class T5 to strikethrough
        => PB1.1: single-strikethrough is used for special chars such as p and q
        => PB1.2: the span doesn't surround the whole word, it is split around the superscripts, etc.
            Which will disrupt the conversion because the words are split across spans

        decide if the layout is completely managed by the viewer
        would be nice if west is on the left of south: that would require to nest one layout inside another
    BUG: when you close the south pane the iframe managed by the nested tinymce will loose the content of its head and body.

Improvements
    Panel asks for location list and types. Populate and show controls accordingly (e.g. Text may not want to display it at this stage, Image only shows locations not types).
    Status messages should come from the server?
    auto-save before large operations

    saving
        saving bugs
            requirements:
                don't count loading as a modification of the text
                don't save too many times
                save all changes

            method:
                use on change event on tinmyce
                    => not triggered until the cursor is moved out of the current line
                        e.g. append chars at the end of a line => nothing, move cursor up => triggered
                        => we may miss changes if the user closes the tab after writing
                compare the size of the content every x seconds
                    => it won't catch modifications which preserve the same length
                    => not the most efficient as we have to get the content each time that's extra processing
                use both
                    => save is triggered twice

        regular saving
            avoid simultaneous savings
            avoid too frequent savings

        [DONE] backup button
            add a new table: TextContentXMLBackup
            add a button to save to this table


Performance
    The full Exon translation (experiment with FireFox):
        can be added with tinymce, pasted from Word it will strip almost all styles and keep minimal HTML
        pasting takes a long time (~20s) but it is decent given the size of the text however it freezes the browser and we can get javascript performance warnings
        the size is 310KB
        loading the text takes just 150ms but setting it into TinyMCE make the browser freeze for a few seconds
        sending the text and saving it to the DB takes less than 1 seconds however the browser tends to freeze and be very laggy after a few operations

Maybe
    Image Panel
        layout selection (width fit, height fit, best fit)
    ? show address selector
    Let panels from different browser tabs communicate
        synchronise position
        edition + refresh views, etc.
    Name tables in the admin: in the future we may want to
        make the slug input writable
        keep the slug as it is even when the name changes
        but if the slug is blanked (or add an icon for that) we reset it.
    Generalise API:
        query for the list of locations and this can be handled by the custom function on server side
    Show status bar at the bottom of each panel:
        duration of the request
        icon to show the message in full
