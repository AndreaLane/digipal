        Q: should we use an intermediary record to represent any type of entity? There are some commonalities among rec types such as normalised name, name before and after conquest, etc. 
        Or do we link directly to a Person/Place record?
        Q: what about the distinction between identified entity and occurrence of an entity name?

        switch the type of view:
            translation

            image
            navigator
    
    Layout
        Layout switches
        [DONE] relative size of the panels. e.g. 50% split centre and south
        Improve the layout so if the set ratios are preserved even when resizing the browser window
        (Re)design:
            decide if the layout is completely managed by the viewer
            would be nice if west is on the left of south: that would require to nest one layout inside another
