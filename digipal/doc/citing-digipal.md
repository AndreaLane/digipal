# Citing DigiPal
 **[_This document is very much in draft. _**_It's not at all clear to me how some of the parts of the site should be cited. These are initial suggestions, but please feel free to comment._]

**The DigiPal Project as a whole** should be cited without a specific author: 


* _DigiPal: Digital Resource and Database of Manuscripts, Palaeography and Diplomatic_. London, 2011–14. Available at [http://www.digipal.eu/](http://www.digipal.eu/) 

**Blogs and News** should give the individual author, title and year specific to that entry:


* S. Brookes, 'Anglo-Saxon MSS Online V: London, Wellcome Historical Medical Library', _DigiPal: Digital Resource and Database of Manuscripts, Palaeography and Diplomatic_ (London, 2014). Available at &lt;[http://www.digipal.eu/blog/wellcome/](http://www.digipal.eu/blog/wellcome/)&gt;

For **individual pages** in the website, add the page title as it appears in the browser, in quotes. [_This means we'll have to make sure all our HTML &lt;title/&gt; elements are correct and unique._]


* 'Folio: BL Additional 40000, 4r', _DigiPal: Digital Resource and Database of Manuscripts, Palaeography and Diplomatic_ (London, 2011–14). Available at &lt;[http://www.digipal.eu/digipal/page/364/](https://digipal.eu/digipal/page/364/)&gt;

And for **annotations:**


* 'Wynn – Folio: BL Additional 40000, 4r', _DigiPal: Digital Resource and Database of Manuscripts, Palaeography and Diplomatic_ (London, 2011–14). Available at &lt;[http://www.digipal.eu/digipal/page/364/?vector_id=OpenLayers_Feature_Vector_5775](http://digipal.eu/digipal/page/364/?vector_id=OpenLayers_Feature_Vector_5775)&gt; Or we use the vector ID:
* 'Wynn 5775', _DigiPal: Digital Resource and Database of Manuscripts, Palaeography and Diplomatic_ (London, 2011–14). Available at &lt;[digipal.eu/digipal/page/364/?vector_id=OpenLayers_Feature_Vector_5775](http://digipal.eu/digipal/page/364/?vector_id=OpenLayers_Feature_Vector_5775)&gt;

For **collections**, cite the name of the collection, the person who compiled it (if available) and the site details. You will probably want to use a short URL, but be sure that the shortening service you are using will preserve your URL for the time that you will need it.


* P.A. Stokes, ed. 'Eadwig Basan's b'. _DigiPal: Digital Resource and Database of Manuscripts, Palaeography and Diplomatic_ (London, 2011–14). &lt;[http://www.digipal.eu/digipal/collection/shared/1/?collection=%7B%22id%22%3A%221%22%2C%22annotations%22%3A%5B12107%2C12108%2C53241%2C53244%2C4284%2C4285%2C11612%2C11613%2C11614%5D%2C%22name%22%3A%22Eadwig%20Basan's%20b%22%7D](http://www.digipal.eu/digipal/collection/shared/1/?collection=%7B%22id%22%3A%221%22%2C%22annotations%22%3A%5B12107%2C12108%2C53241%2C53244%2C4284%2C4285%2C11612%2C11613%2C11614%5D%2C%22name%22%3A%22Eadwig%20Basan)&gt;

The **software** falls into two categories. That which has been written by the DigiPal team is as follows:


* _DigiPal: Digital Resource and Database of Manuscripts, Palaeography and Diplomatic_ (London, 2011–14). Software, available at &lt;[https://github.com/kcl-ddh/digipal](https://github.com/kcl-ddh/digipal)&gt;

The software also uses several third-party libraries which should be cited when appropriate.

# Possible Models from Other Projects

## Samuel Beckett Archive: D. Van Hulle and Mark Nixon (dir) and V. Neyt (tech. realisation), Samuel Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (Brussels, 2013). Available at &lt;[http://www.beckettarchive.org](http://www.beckettarchive.org/)&gt;

### Old Bailey Online
Users who wish to cite material from the website in publications should, as with all internet publications, cite the URL ([www.oldbaileyonline.org](http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/)) and the date on which the website was consulted. Additionally, they should also cite the **version number** (i.e. 7.0), found in the bottom left of every page on this site. This website is updated at least once a year, and including the version number allows others to trace your research process. See the [What's New Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20140410065148/http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Whats-new-archive.jsp) for information about changes to the site and when they were implemented.

**The Project**

To cite the project and web site as a whole please use the following format:


* Tim Hitchcock, Robert Shoemaker, Clive Emsley, Sharon Howard and Jamie McLaughlin, et al., The Old Bailey Proceedings Online, 1674-1913 ([www.oldbaileyonline.org](http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/), version 7.0, 24 March 2012).

Subsequent citations might be shortened to:


* Old Bailey Proceedings [or OBP].

See [Project Staff](http://web.archive.org/web/20140410065148/http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Project.jsp) for a complete list of the project team, and their roles in creating the site.

 

**Trials, Sessions and Ordinary's Accounts**

Recommended citation formats are available by clicking on the **Cite this text** link in the yellow box at the top of all texts.

### Online Froissart
**General**

Users wishing to cite material from the Online Froissart in publications should always provide a reference to the website. At the very least such a reference should include the website’s title (‘The Online Froissart’), general editors (Peter Ainsworth and Godfried Croenen), URL ([http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart)) and the date on which the website was consulted.

We also recommend that the version number and publication year of the particular version of the website consulted be included (see [Versions](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/apparatus.jsp?type=context&amp;context=versions)). The particular format of the citation used will depend on the stylesheet used and on the purpose of the particular reference (in a footnote or bibliography, reference to the website in general, or to a particular part thereof). The examples given below set out the general principles and follow the [MHRA](http://www.mhra.org.uk/index.html) style guide. They will need to be slightly adapted for different stylesheets.

 **References to the whole resource**

For general references to the whole web resource, such as those typically found in the Bibliography sections of a book or article, the following citation format should be used:


* Ainsworth, Peter, and Godfried Croenen, ed., _The Online Froissart_, version 1.5 (Sheffield: HRIOnline, 2013), &lt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart)&gt; [accessed 30 December 2013].

 Users who want to include in their reference the names of all contributors should use the following format:


* Ainsworth, Peter, and Godfried Croenen, ed., _The Online Froissart_, transcriptions and XML markup by Peter Ainsworth, Vanessa Cardoso, Godfried Croenen, Mike Kestemont, Caroline Lambert, Sofie Loomans, Simon Littler, Valentina Mazzei, Hartley Miller, Katariina Närä, Florent Noirfalise, Natasha Romanova, Mary Rouse, Richard Rouse, Rob Sanderson, Dirk Schoenaers, Alexandra Vanguchte and Gem Wheeler, annotation by Peter Ainsworth, Christopher Allmand, Godfried Croenen, Katariina Närä and Inès Villela-Petit, translation by Keira Borrill, essays by Peter Ainsworth, Christopher Allmand, Godfried Croenen, Anne Curry, Sofie Loomans, Valentina Mazzei, Katariina Närä, Christiane Raynaud and Inès Villela-Petit, digital photography by David Cooper and Colin Dunn, technical development by Jamie McLaughlin, Michael Meredith, Michael Pidd and Gilles Souvay, version 1.5 (Sheffield: HRIOnline, 2013), &lt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart)&gt; [accessed 30 December 2013].

 

**References to specific parts of the resource**

Users who need to refer to specific sections of the resource can follow different strategies. The most straightforward method would be to indicate in normal prose those sections to which a reference is needed (transcriptions of particular manuscripts, reproduction of a particular folio, etc.) and then use the general format of the bibliographical citation as given above. This may often be the clearest way of referring to what could be a complex view of the website that combines many sets of data.

Certain discrete parts of the Online Froissart, however, should preferably be cited as such when a reference is made to a particular passage or piece of information. These include the translation, essays and miniature commentaries.

For references to the translation of the _Chroniques_ the following format should be used:


* Borrill, Keira, transl., ‘Jean Froissart, Chronicles’, in _The Online Froissart_, ed. by Peter Ainsworth and Godfried Croenen, version 1.5 (Sheffield: HRIOnline, 2013), &lt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart)&gt; [accessed 30 December 2013].

References to the essays should include the author's name and the essay title. In these references the general URL of the website can be replaced by the precise URL for the article:


* Närä, Katariina, ‘Some Burgundian manuscripts of Froissart's Chroniques, With Particular Emphasis on British Library ms. Harley 4379-80’, in _The Online Froissart_, ed. by Peter Ainsworth and Godfried Croenen, version 1.5 (Sheffield: HRIOnline, 2013), &lt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/apparatus.jsp?type=intros&amp;intro=f.intros.KN-Burgundian](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/apparatus.jsp?type=intros&amp;intro=f.intros.KN-Burgundian)&gt; [accessed 30 December 2012].

 Miniature commentaries should be cited in the same way as the essays:


* Ainsworth, Peter and Inès Villela-Petit, ‘Book II Miniatures, Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS fr. 2664’, in _The Online Froissart_, ed. by Peter Ainsworth and Godfried Croenen, version 1.5 (Sheffield: HRIOnline, 2013), &lt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/apparatus.jsp?type=context&amp;context=miniature_commentaries](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/apparatus.jsp?type=context&amp;context=miniature_commentaries)&gt; [accessed 30 December 2013].

References to original manuscripts, when the digital reproductions have been consulted, should include the reference to the original manuscript as well as to the digital surrogates on the Online Froissart website. Please note that no form of reproduction of the digital images is allowed without first obtaining written permission (see [Copyright and Permissions](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/apparatus.jsp?type=context&amp;context=copyright_and_permissions)):


* Besançon, Bibliothèque municipale, MS 864, fol. 27r, reproduction in Ainsworth, Peter, and Godfried Croenen, ed., _The Online Froissart_, version 1.5 (Sheffield: HRIOnline, 2013), &lt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart)&gt; [accessed 30 December 2013].

It is possible in references to manuscript images to replace the generic URL with the specific reference for the particular folio. The name of the photographer can also be added (for details see [Inventory of Images](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/apparatus.jsp?type=context&amp;context=inventory_of_images)):


* Besançon, Bibliothèque municipale, MS 864, fol. 27r, digital photography by David Cooper and Colin Dunn, in _The Online Froissart_, ed. by Peter Ainsworth and Godfried Croenen, version 1.5 (Sheffield: HRIOnline, 2013), &lt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/apparatus.jsp?type=vv&amp;xmlid=Bes-1_27r](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/apparatus.jsp?type=vv&amp;xmlid=Bes-1_27r)&gt; [accessed 30 December 2013].

Users who want to refer to the whole corpus of transcriptions and who would like to include in their reference the names of all text editors and transcribers should use the following format:


* Ainsworth, Peter, and Godfried Croenen, ed., _The Online Froissart_, transcriptions by Peter Ainsworth, Vanessa Cardoso, Godfried Croenen, Mike Kestemont, Caroline Lambert, Sofie Loomans, Simon Littler, Valentina Mazzei, Hartley Miller, Katariina Närä, Florent Noirfalise, Natasha Romanova, Mary Rouse, Richard Rouse, Rob Sanderson, Dirk Schoenaers, Alexandra Vanguchte and Gem Wheeler, annotation by Katariina Närä, version 1.5 (Sheffield: HRIOnline, 2013), &lt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart)&gt; [accessed 30 December 2013].

Users wishing to cite the edition of a particular manuscript can refer to it by the editor(s) or transcriber(s) responsible for it, the part of the _Chroniqes_ it contains, and the bibliographical reference of the original manuscript, using the following format (for details on individual contributions see [Contents of the Resource](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/apparatus.jsp?type=context&amp;context=contents_of_the_resource)):


* Mazzei, Valentina, ed., ‘Jean Froissart, Chroniques, Book I and Book II (part), Besançon, Bibliothèque municipale, MS 864’, in _The Online Froissart_, ed. by Peter Ainsworth and Godfried Croenen, version 1.5 (Sheffield: HRIOnline, 2013), &lt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart)&gt; [accessed 30 December 2013].

**References to specific views of the website**

The Online Froissart allows users to browse all the material from the underlying datasets, but also to conduct very detailed and complex searches and comparisons. There will be times when users may want to refer to the results of such interactive use of the website in their own publications. In order to provide precise information they can rely on the fact that the web address (displayed in the address field of the browser) always contains all the information to recreate a particular view. This is the case with views which align two or more transcriptions (viz. transcription and translation, transcription and reproduction), or the Collate view which aligns two or more transcriptions on a word-by-word basis. Cutting and pasting the web address from the browser will therefore provide another reader with the precise reference to the same view combining exactly the same sets of data.

There are two major drawbacks to this approach. The first is that these addresses, especially when several sets of data are being combined, can be very long. This would probably make them unsuitable for use in printed editions. Even if they are used in a print publication, it would also be difficult for a reader correctly to retype such a long address.

The second drawback is that there is no guarantee that such addresses will remain stable between versions. Views of the website which rely on manuscript folios or SHF chapters (simple browsing mode of transcriptions and/or reproductions, synchronised browsing mode based on chapter numbers) are likely to remain the same (unless mistakes were made and then corrected in the encoding of folio or chapter numbers). The word collation (Collate) view, however, is based on data that is recreated for each new published version. Web addresses referring to views based on the collation data should therefore not be used in references or, when they are, users should keep in mind that they will probably only remain usable for a limited period (a year or less). Users can recognise these views because the web addresses start with “[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart)&gt; [accessed 30 December 2013], fol. 29r.

For combinations of transcriptions of two or more manuscripts, folio numbers could also be used, but it may be more efficient to use the canonical referencing system underlying the Online Froissart. We have used a system based on the section numbers in the edition of Books I-III published by the _Société de l’Histoire de France_, with a small number of additions and corrections. These references are shown in the transcriptions and translations as blue boxes, with the abbreviation SHF, followed by a reference. The first part of the reference is to the Book (in arabic: 1, 2 or 3), optionally followed by one or two letters to indicate a particular version of the chapter or Book (‘A’, ‘Am’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘M’, ‘N’, ‘R’, ‘RT’, ‘T’). After the hyphen comes the chapter number (indicated by the § sign in the printed _Société de l’Histoire de France_ edition). In some cases the numbering in the edition is ambiguous, and ‘bis’ has therefore been added to disambiguate two sections which have the same number in the _Société de l’Histoire de France_ edition.

The SHF chapter numbers can be used for references to collation-based views combining two or more manuscripts:

Jean Froissart, ‘Chronicles, Book II’, in _The Online Froissart_, ed. by Peter Ainsworth and Godfried Croenen, version 1.5 (Sheffield: HRIOnline, 2013), &lt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart](http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart)&gt; [accessed 30 December 2013], SHF § 36 (MSS Berlin Hamilton 266, Berlin Rehdiger 3, Paris Arsenal 5188).
